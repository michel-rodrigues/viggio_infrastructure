# Viggio - Infrastructure

Viggio was a project strongly based on cameo.com, a platform where you can buy a video directly from a celebrity - which in this project is referred to as Talent. The entire development context was designed to be an MVP, with all resource limitations and time restrictions inherent to this type of project, taking 5 months to complete. This project also served as a sandbox for me to experiment with technologies like Kubernetes and Google Cloud

This repository contains the files used to provision a backend application written in Python and the infrastructure to serve static files from the front end. The backend project can be found in this repository: https://github.com/michel-rodrigues/viggio_backend
